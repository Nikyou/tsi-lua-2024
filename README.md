This is a 6th semester System Analysis and Modelling Practical Assignment for TSI University Latvia.
* MO1: Apply modern system analysis and modelling concepts/approaches/ methods to complex systems analysis and understand the role of simulation models in the decision-making process.
* MO2: Using the complex system analysis life-cycle, explain and distinguish the role of each stage of the life-cycle (defining the input and output of each stage).
* MO3: Develop simulation models using modern simulation software, validate and tune models using a variety of validation methods and approaches.
* MO4: Develop a set of experiment scenarios, establish measures of effectiveness (MoE) and devise a data collection strategy. Execute the experiments using the model, gathering output data for subsequent analysis.
* MO5: Interpret outcomes of simulations, make suitable recommendations and communicate these with stakeholders.
